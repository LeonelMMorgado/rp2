Questão 15:

“justice, each getting what he or she is due. Formal justice is
the impartial and consistent application of principles, whether
or not the principles themselves are just. Substantive justice
is closely associated with rights, i.e., with what individuals can
legitimately demand of one another or what they can
legitimately demand of their government (e.g., with respect
to the protection of liberty or the promotion of equality).

Retributive justice concerns when and why punishment is
justified. Debate continues over whether punishment is
justified as retribution for past wrongdoing or because it
deters future wrongdoing. Those who stress retribution as the
justification for punishment usually believe human beings
have libertarian free will, while those who stress deterrence
usually accept determinism.

At least since Aristotle, justice has commonly been identified
both with obeying law and with treating everyone with
fairness. But if law is, and justice is not, entirely a matter of
convention, then justice cannot be identified with obeying
law.”
