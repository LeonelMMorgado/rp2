Questão 88:

The main players in the Spanish–Aztec War (1519–21) 
are well known: Hernán Cortés and Montezuma. Lesser-known, 
though no less important, is a multilingual exiled Aztec woman 
who was enslaved, then served as a guide and interpreter, then 
became Cortés’s mistress. She was known as Doña Marina, and 
as La Malinche. 
Scholar and researcher Cordelia Candelaria writes: her 
paramount value to the Spaniards was not merely linguistic. 
She was an interpreter/liaison who served as a guide to the 
region, as an advisor on native customs and beliefs, and as a 
strategist. 
La Malinche was the daughter of an Aztec cacique 
(chief). This gave her an unusual level of education, which she 
would later leverage as a guide and interpreter for the Spanish. 
Throughout Cortés’s travels, she became indispensable as a 
translator, not only capable of functionally translating from one 
language to the other, but of speaking compellingly, 
strategizing, and forging political connections.  
Integral as she was to Spain’s success, La Malinche is a 
controversial figure. Candelaria quotes T. R. Fehrenbach as 
saying, “If there is one villainess in Mexican history, she is La 
Malinche. She was to become the ethnic traitress supreme.” 
But Candelaria argues that La Malinche’s act of turning her back 
on her own people makes more psychological sense when we 
consider that, at a young age, she had been sold by her own 
mother into slavery. Candelaria asks, “What else could this 
outcast from the Aztecs, ‘her own people,’ have done?”
